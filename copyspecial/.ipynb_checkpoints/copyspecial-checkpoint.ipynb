    "# Google Python class in Julia Part 3: Copyspecial\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of teaching myself Python (after doing so half-heartedly for about a year) I completed Google's Python course. Also during that time period, I was learning Julia and mostly using its packages to check the results of various statistical models (GLM, MixedModels). What is nice about Julia is that it combines the best parts of Python, MATLAB, and R. For current purposes, it shares several data structures with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "One goal of mine is to make code and analyses portable across platforms and programs. The Google Python course is good for this, at it instructs how to perform basic tasks (file I/O, counts, low-level tokenization) using base Python. Julia is a good language to port this to, as not only it shares data structures, but also is designed to be fast; something that could be very useful when doing basic NLP-like tasks in batches. So in order to familiarize myself with Julia and learn how to port things, I will implement the exercises in Julia.\n",

The first part of of the exercise focuses on getting the absolute paths of the files. The second part involves copying the files. The third part focuses on commands to create the ZIP archive.\n"
